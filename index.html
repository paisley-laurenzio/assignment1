    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
    <p>Canadian born and raised, art has always been a large part of my story. It started as a hobby, developed into a passion and is soon to become a career.  Currently I am a student in the Algonquin College School of Media and Design. Photography has always been something I enjoyed.  I have always loved the challenge of capturing people in my photographs and connecting with them in a way that they feel comfortable and I am able to capture their true character. Though having live subjects can pose many difficulties I love the challenge of capturing emotion and personality in my subjects.</p>

    <h2>How to Capture Emotion and Personality</h2>

    <p>It is extremely difficult to capture a natural expression that shows the true personality of the subject. There has to be a connection between the photographer and the subject on a level that breaks a barrier and allows the subject to become entirely confortable. The worst nightmare for photographers when photographing people is when the expression captured is obviously a forced one.</p>

        <p>There are several things that a photographer can do to capture the true personality of the subject. It is important that you are confident and comfortable with a clear idea of what you want. If you are comfortable and able to direct your subject confidently your subject will feel much more comfortable, opening up and revealing their true personality. You have to be prepared to spend the first part of a photo shoot breaking in your subject until you are able to capture their comfortable natural character. It is important to understand how to reach this level of comfort with your subject. With children it is often easiest to distract them with fun stories and to get them talking. For more mature subjects they will often feel most comfortable when you confidently direct them, telling them how to stand and what facial expression you want.</p>
